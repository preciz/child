# Simplified state machine of a 4 years old child.

## Goal:
Build a state machine based on the diagram below in your favourite language.
The initial state is "playing".

![States](states.png?raw=true "States")

## Constraints:
* You cannot use any third party library.
* Every transition should be printed on screen containing the "from" and "to" state in a readable sentence.
* Impossible transitions should raise an exception.
