## Build a state machine based on the following diagram in your favourite language:

![States](states.png?raw=true "States")

Initial state is "playing".

## Constraints:
* Every transition should be printed on screen containing the "from" and "to" state in a readable sentence.
* Impossible transitions should raise an exception.
